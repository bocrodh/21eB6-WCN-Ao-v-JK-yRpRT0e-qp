Many advanced and emerging economies allow both types of access to a broader range of entities, including foreign FIs (eg Switzerland), fintechs (eg HK, Australia), and non-bank PSPs (eg UK).

There are two distinct types of SAs: those that are systemic and those that are not. SAs that have the potential to pose systemic or payment system risk would best be covered under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act (PCSA). Currently, the PCSA does not give the Bank clear autiority to designate SAs. Analytical work on potential amendments to the PCSA has been completed and initial discussions with Finance will took place in early-Medium0MediumMedium. Any potential changes to the Act will likely come in Medium0MediumHigh (exact timing is uncertain at this stage). 

For non-systemic SAs, the work on regulatory gaps and potential solutions has been started and is progressing under a FISC sub-group.",Low,"For systemic SA:

The PCSA does not currently give the Bank clear authority to designate stablecoin arrangements. This is because the Act’s definition of clearing and settlement system does not accommodate settlement in digital tokens or distributed ledger technology (DLT). 

Easily justifiable amendments can be made to the PCSA to try and ensure that the Act remains technolo-gy-neutral and flexible to accommodate new types of clearing and settlement arrangements based on stablecoins that pose either payment system of systemic risk. These revolve around changes to the defini-tions of “clearing and settlement system” and “clearing house” in the PCSA. 

Other jurisdictions (like the UK) are more advanced in their regulatory regimes for entities that would be classified as stablecoin arrangements.

For non-systemic SA:

Currently in Canada, there is regulatory uncertainty about whether SAs can be appropriately captured by existing frameworks and who the main regulatory authority would be. Other jurisdictions (like the EU, UK etc) are more advanced in their approach.","Work done by SAG group.
