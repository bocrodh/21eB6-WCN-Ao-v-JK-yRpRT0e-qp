Internal report (based on BB10, Action 1) is available to CPMI members.

While public plicy objective in Canada evolve around safety and resilience, the Payments Mordernization Plan (see relevant column) acknowledges the relevance of innovation in achieving safety and resilience.",Low,"Direct access has two (related) aspects: direct access to the payment system and account access at the central bank. 

Many advanced and emerging economies allow both types of access to a broader range of entities, including foreign FIs (eg Switzerland), fintechs (eg HK, Australia), and non-bank PSPs (eg UK). 

In Canada, direct access to the payment system is quite narrow and is controlled by the CP Act. 

In constrast, the Bank allows account access to a wider range of entities, including (dometic and foreign) FMIs. 

Many CPMI jurisdictions (e.g. UK and Australia) also have a published access and settlement account policy; we do not have such public disclosure of our policies.

At the end of 2020, there were 111 members of the association.  According to Lynx Rule 3, the following conditions also need to be met in order to participate in Lynx: (i) Confirmation from the Bank that the applicant has been approved for accounts at the Bank needed for the purpose of Settlement of Lynx Payment Obligations and the making and repayment of Intraday Loans and Overnight Advances, and related requirements, as set out in the Lynx By-law; (ii) confirmation from SWIFT that: the applicant is a member of SWIFT; the SWIFT BIC address(es) associated with the application is/are designated as a Canadian address(es);  the applicant has completed all qualification and certification tests required by SWIFT; (iii) a description by the applicant of its back-up capability for its Lynx operations.

There are two distinct types of SAs: those that are systemic and those that are not. SAs that have the potential to pose systemic or payment system risk would best be covered under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act (PCSA). Currently, the PCSA does not give the Bank clear autiority to designate SAs. Analytical work on potential amendments to the PCSA has been completed and initial discussions with Finance will took place in early-2022. Any potential changes to the Act will likely come in 2023 (exact timing is uncertain at this stage). 

For non-systemic SAs, the work on regulatory gaps and potential solutions has been started and is progressing under a FISC sub-group.",Low,"For systemic SA:

The PCSA does not currently give the Bank clear authority to designate stablecoin arrangements. This is because the Act’s definition of clearing and settlement system does not accommodate settlement in digital tokens or distributed ledger technology (DLT). 

Easily justifiable amendments can be made to the PCSA to try and ensure that the Act remains technolo-gy-neutral and flexible to accommodate new types of clearing and settlement arrangements based on stablecoins that pose either payment system of systemic risk. These revolve around changes to the defini-tions of “clearing and settlement system” and “clearing house” in the PCSA. 

Other jurisdictions (like the UK) are more advanced in their regulatory regimes for entities that would be classified as stablecoin arrangements.

For non-systemic SA:

Currently in Canada, there is regulatory uncertainty about whether SAs can be appropriately captured by existing frameworks and who the main regulatory authority would be. Other jurisdictions (like the EU, UK etc) are more advanced in their approach.","Work done by SAG group.
